# Project Name: Responsive Webpage for a Portfolio Sample Page.

In this project, I created a responsive website for my sample portfolio page. I used HTML to structure the content and include some semantic tags and elements like headings, main, section, paragraphs, div, and
footer. Media queries were employed to facilitate responsive design, while a CSS framework like Tailwind was used to enhance the overall design/styling. 

#Activity

- In the portfolio project, I used Tailwind classes to structure the layout, style components, and embrace the visual of the webpage. 
- In the header section, I utilized tailwind classes for background color, text color and padding.
- I designed a footer with social media icons, copyright information, and links using tailwind classes for flexbox, icon styling and text alignment.

- In the portfolio sample page, I inserted the header section (with three items: home, projects, contact, hero section (with background image and headline introducing myself), skills section, projects sections, contact form and footer.
- I applied Tailwind classes in all of these sections. 

#Tools
- I used Tailwind documentation (also an extension on VS Code)
- I used Tailwind Css intelligensia.
- I used the 'tailwind fold' extension to help me collapse class attributes.
