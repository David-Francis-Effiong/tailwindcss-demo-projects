# Project Name: Responsive Webpage for an Online Blog and a Portfolio Sample Page.

In this project, I created a responsive website for an online blog (TechVibe) and my sample portfolio page. I used HTML to structure the content and include some semantic tags and elements like headings, main, section, paragraphs, div, and
footer. Media queries were employed to facilitate responsive design, while a CSS framework like Tailwind was used to enhance the overall design/styling. 

#Activity

- In the online blog, I used tailwind classes to structure the layout, style components, and embrace the visual of the webpage. 
- In the header section, I utilized tailwind classes for background color, text color and padding.
- I showcased three featured blog posts with images, titles, and excerpts. I also applied tailwind classes for cards, image styling and text alignment.
- In the category section, I utilized tailwind classes for badges /tags.
- There is a recent posts section displaying a list of recent blog posts with titles and publication dates.
- In the Newsletter subscription form, I included a simple form for newsletter subscription.
- I designed a footer with social media icons, copyright information, and links using tailwind classes for flexbox, icon styling and text alignment.

- -In the portfolio sample page, I inserted the header section (with three items: home, projects, contact, hero section (with background image and headline introducing myself), skills section, projects sections, contact form and footer.
- -I applied tailwind classes in all of these sections.
